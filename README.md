# ASCIIToSVG

Create beautiful SVG diagrams from ASCII art.

## Information

This is a placeholder for the ASCIIToSVG project. The original code at 
https://github.com/dhobsd/asciitosvg suffers from a number of issues. This
repository exists to be the canonical repository for the project as well
as to stage work for the Go port.
